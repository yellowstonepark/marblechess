# **Things to do.md**

There are *many* things to do.

Rules of chess:

## How the game works

White moves first.
Black and white take turns.
You can only move *once* in a turn.
You may **not** capture your own piece.
A piece may **not** leave the chessboard unless it is taken ***or*** the pawn is turning in to another piece.
When you are *checked*, that means that there is a piece **attacking** your king.
If in check, you cannot move your king, block the piece attacking the king, or take the attacking piece, that means you are in ***checkmate***. Checkmate means that **you lost**.
**You may not stay in check** for the game- you must get out of it.
Checkmate is the *only* way to win.

## How to move the pieces

#### A pawn
A pawn may **only** go one space forward, **unless** a piece is in it's way.
A pawn may **only** attack one space diagonally, but **cannot** go diagonal if it is not attacking.
A pawn may go two spaces **if** it is on the starting row.
When a pawn reaches the end of the chessboard, it **must** turn in to the piece you want it to turn in to.
It may not jump over other pieces.
#### A rook
A rook may only move **horizontally and vertically**.
It may not jump over other pieces.
#### A bishop
A bishop may only move **diagonally**.
It may not jump over other pieces.
#### The king
The king can move **one space in any direction**.
It may not jump over other pieces.
#### The queen
The queen can move **horizontally and vertically and diagonal any amount of spaces**.
It may not jump over other pieces.
#### The knight
**The knight is the only piece that can jump over pieces.**
The knight can move like so: one space vertically or horizontally, then two spaces vertically or horizontally. You can go the two spaces first, or the one space first. The night moves like an uppercase L.
#### The king
The king *can move* **one space in any direction**, *as long as it does not enter check.*

## Other Rules

There must be 32 or less chess pieces on the chessboard.
*Stalemate* is when you or your opponent cannot make any moves that are allowed (legal Moves.)
A piece may not move if it were to move, the king would be in check.

## Special Moves

#### Castling
*Castling* is when the rook switches with the king when there is **no pieces between the king and the rook**, mainly to protect the king.
A king can castle when **one of the rooks have not been moved** and **the king have not been moved**.
**Any of the two rooks may be used to castle**, as long as they have not been moved.
To castle, move the king two space towards the rook, then move the rook to the other side of the king.
A castle can be done when the **king is not in check**, **not moving through check**, and **not moving in to check**.

#### En passant
A move, called *en passant* is when a pawn is right next to your pawn, you can move forward one and capture the other side's pawn
En passant is *only* allowed when the opponent moves 2 spaces on their first time moving a pawn and their is next to your pawn.
